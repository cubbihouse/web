					<h2>About</h2>
					<img src="images/content/group-photo-for-web-site2.jpg" alt="Group members" />
					<p>In September of 2009, a group of old friends sat down around a boardroom table to talk business. A shared passion for music had brought them together many years before, and numerous bands and musical projects had been spawned from the merging of their creative talents. This meeting however, was sparked by their desire to write music for children. It had to be fun, but it had to be serious business too. After all, they were grown-ups now. One by one they spruiked their ideas. Between belly-laughs and sing-alongs, pitches were fine-tuned and business proposals presented until, eventually, the idea for Cubbihouse (a children&rsquo;s music production company) was born.</p>
					<p>The eight members of Cubbihouse, many of whom are teachers and parents themselves, researched and developed a concept based around producing music that parents would love just as much as their kids would. It had to be educational, fun, edgy and kid-friendly, but it had to be adult-friendly too. While Cubbihouse were researching the concept, many parents told them that the majority of kids&rsquo; music products currently on the market were irritating, especially when played over and over again. So Cubbihouse had to find out just what it was that kids wanted to hear over and over again, but change the rules a little so that all members of the family could enjoy it.</p>
					<h3>Rockin&rsquo; the Cubbihouse</h3>
					<p>A year or so on and many rollicking creative meetings later, Cubbihouse have released their first product; a CD called Rockin&rsquo; the Cubbihouse. With such titles as &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Allowed to Ride Around the Block&rdquo;, &ldquo;Tippy Toes,&rdquo; &ldquo;Rain, Rain Go Away,&rdquo; and &ldquo; Kickin&rsquo; Balls,&rdquo; this rock-inspired album shines a joy-filled light on some of the most simple, but memorable, moments from childhood, inspiring listeners to laugh, dance and sing along. It is an album for kids aged from 3 to infinity. Rockin&rsquo; the Cubbihouse pays homage to contemporary music, giving shameless nods to everything from Glam 80s Rock, to Reggae, to Folk Pop, to Heavy Metal.</p>
					<p>Cubbihouse is a labour of love for its company members, all of whom are busy with demanding day jobs. But the weekly meetings, creative weekends, collaborative song writing sessions and time spent in the recording studio are always accompanied by a joy de vivre rarely found in the workplace. When Cubbihouse tap into their collective inner-child something truly special happens.</p>
					<p>Stay tuned for future installments from Cubbihouse.</p>
