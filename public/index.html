<div id="about" class="section">

<h2>About</h2>
<img src="images/content/group-photo-for-web-site2.jpg" alt="Group members">
<p>In
September of 2009, a group of old friends sat down around a boardroom
table to talk business. A shared passion for music had brought them
together many years before, and numerous bands and musical projects had
been spawned from the merging of their creative talents. This meeting
however, was sparked by their desire to write music for children. It
had to be fun, but it had to be serious business too. After all, they
were grown-ups now. One by one they spruiked their ideas. Between
belly-laughs and sing-alongs, pitches were fine-tuned and business
proposals presented until, eventually, the idea for Cubbihouse (a
children's music production company) was born.</p>
<p>The eight
members of Cubbihouse, many of whom are teachers and parents
themselves, researched and developed a concept based around producing
music that parents would love just as much as their kids would. It had
to be educational, fun, edgy and kid-friendly, but it had to be
adult-friendly too. While Cubbihouse were researching the concept, many
parents told them that the majority of kids' music products currently
on the market were irritating, especially when played over and over
again. So Cubbihouse had to find out just what it was that kids wanted
to hear over and over again, but change the rules a little so that all
members of the family could enjoy it.</p>
<h3>Awesome Music Products<br>
</h3>
<p>A
year or so on and many rollicking creative meetings later, Cubbihouse
released their first product; a CD called Rockin' the Cubbihouse.
With such titles as "I'm Allowed to Ride Around the Block", "Tippy
Toes", "Rain, Rain Go Away", and "Kickin' Balls", this rock-inspired
album shines a joy-filled light on some of the most simple, but
memorable, moments from childhood, inspiring listeners to laugh, dance
and sing along. It is an album for kids aged from 3 to infinity.
Rockin' the Cubbihouse pays homage to contemporary music, giving
shameless nods to everything from Glam 80s Rock, to Reggae, to Folk
Pop, to Heavy Metal.</p>
<p>Rockin' The Cubbihouse was soon followed by My Musical Day, a
special language development CD that was developed in partnership with
the Telethon Speech &amp; Hearing Centre&nbsp; For Kids (TSH). The
product had immediate impact in Perth, with speech pathologists using
and recommending the product and Today Tonight broadcasting a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUGTNxDSkiU" target="_blank">special
feature</a> on the amazing story behind the project. Read all about My
Musical Day <a href="www.my-musical-day.com" target="_blank">here</a>.
25% of product sales go to TSH.<br>
</p>
<p>Cubbihouse is a labour of love for its
company members, all of whom are busy with demanding day jobs. But the
weekly meetings, creative weekends, collaborative song writing
sessions, LIVE shows
and time spent in the recording studio are always accompanied by a joy
de vivre rarely found in the workplace. When Cubbihouse tap into their
collective inner-child something truly special happens.</p>
<p>Stay
tuned for future installments from Cubbihouse as we seek to establish
the company as a successful business and permanent fixture in the Perth
music landscape.<br>

<p>Would you like Cubbihouse to perform at your next children’s party,
function or event? Cubbihouse Live has an outstanding reputation for
getting the party started. There are two energetic, fun-filled options
available; both designed to delight the little people in your life. </p>

<h3>Option 1 - Small Band</h3>
<p> This is best suited to smaller functions such as birthday parties
and backyard soirees. A small band of two (with a big band sound) will
deliver all your favorite Cubbihouse tunes. The show is designed to
have the kids singing, dancing and laughing along. </p>
<h3>Option 2 - Larger Band</h3>
<p> This is an even more dynamic, visual show with the whole band...
guitar, drums, keyboard and vocals. Seeing a real band performing with
real instruments is a mesmerising experience for young children. It's
an opportunity for them to see just how music is made. This energetic,
interactive show is best suited to outdoor events, festivals and
concerts, although it is also available at “low volume” for smaller
parties. </p>
